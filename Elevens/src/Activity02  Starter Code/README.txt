1. The Deck is an array of Cards
2. 6 cards
3. ranks = {two,three,four,five,six,seven,eight,nine,ten,jack,queen,king,ace}
   suits = {hearts, clubs, spades, diamonds}
   values = {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,10,10,10,11}
4. the rank and value orders matter
I wrote the code in a separate project in netbeans, not sure what you want me to do with it
